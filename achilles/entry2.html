<h6>The Appointment</h6>
<p>
	As per ER doctors orders (mostly through accidental confusion), I waited a week just to make sure my injury was not improving. When it did not, I went to see a sports doctor well-known to our family up in Westchester. Unfortunately, his office is a bit of a hike when you cannot walk and do not have access to a car. Naturally, we (my father and I) took the train and at least 5 taxis.

	I spent my first five minutes at the office uncertainly filling out about 12 forms regarding something along the lines of my righs, health insurance information, my medical history, contact information, and who knows what else. After that I waited about about 20 minutes in the pleasantly empty waiting area before seeing the doc. Our visit lasted about 5 minutes. I gave him a two sentence description of how I became injured and then he did a physical exam of my injury (the calf-squeeze test). It was definitely a partial tear, he said it moved-but a lot less than the intact achilles so I needed to get an MRI. Other than knowing that if my tear was more that 50% I should have surgery, I learned very little and left somewhat disappointed.
