<h6>What Is Normal? (thoughts from May)</h6>
<p>
	Afer a few of my various doctor appointments I quickly understood that my definitily of normal is not entirely conventional. I would have to redefine normal in order to set realistic expectations for myself. For me, normal has always been playing soccer 3-5 days a week. Going hiking two or three days a month. Biking to the pool once a week for a swim. Attempting to build an igloo, even when the calliber blizzard is grossly overestimated by the weather people and there is not nearly enough snow. Trying to convince everyone I know to go camping all the time. Having two beers without my ankle swelling even more than its already puffed up today. But apparently not all of these things are entirely normal...
	</p>
	<p>They (one of the many doctorish people I've seen over the last few months) said I will be back to normal/everyday activities 4-5 months post-op. That is thrilling to hear at first, until you reailze that normal and everyday activities do not include hiking or camping, starting kickboxing classes or awkward dancing. They definitely do not include soccer of any kind, though I will at least be juggleing by then to keep myself from going crazy. At least there's PT to look forward to...</p>
