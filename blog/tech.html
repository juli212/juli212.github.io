		<h2>Recursion?</h2>
		<h6>March 12, 2016</h6>
		<h3>What Is Recursion?</h3>
    <p>
    	As everyone seems to say, "to understand recursion, you must first understand recursion." Recursion is a general programming concept that is used in many languages where a function calls itself inside itself an unknown number of times, until conditions that break the loop are met. In many situations, recursion can replace longer pieces of code as long as it is written correctly but he danger is similar to any other looping situation: infinite looping! 
		</p>
		<h3>When To Use Recursion?</h3>
    <p> 
  		Since recursion is a way to loop through a method an unknown number of times when some of the conditions are unknown, one of the advantages to using recursion is that the loop will run once, then check to see if there is another object to run the code on before running again. Situations the call for recursion are varied but a simple example is iterating through a nested array with an unknown number of layers. In this situation, you cannot tell the method how many layers deep to iterate through because it is unknown but you can tell it to check each object to see if it is an array and if it is, iterate through each item in it...but first checking to see if each item in that nested array is an array and iterating through each of those items as well. 
  	</p>
		<p>
      For visual learners, here is a nice node tree that depicts how recursion works:

    <p>
    	Here, the method is done to each node in alphabetical order, starting with node A and proceeding to check if each node has a sub-node (this is definitely not the technical term...) where the method is done to that sub-node after checking to see if that sub-node has a sub-sub-node. Once the method has been done to all the levels of sub-nodes on the left-most line (here its A-B-C-D), the method goes back up one level to node C and then down to the second sub-node of C which is E before moving back up two levels to node B and going to B's second sub-node (F). This process is repeated until the method has gone through all of the nodes and sub-nodes and there are none left.
