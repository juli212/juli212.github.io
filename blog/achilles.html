		<h2>Achilles</h2>
		<p>At the end of January, I tore my achilles playing soccer. I have decided to document my return to soccer and being fully functional again. Here it is:</p>

		<h3><span class="entry-day">Day 7</span>: The Sport Doctor<span class="entry-date"> February 03, 2017</span></h3>
<!-- 		<h6>The Appointment</h6>
		<p>
			As per ER doctors orders (mostly through accidental confusion), I waited a week just to make sure my injury was not improving. When it did not, I went to see a sports doctor well-known to our family up in Westchester. Unfortunately, his office is a bit of a hike when you cannot walk and do not have access to a car. Naturally, we (my father and I) took the train and at least 5 taxis.
		</p>
		<p>
			I spent my first five minutes at the office uncertainly filling out about 12 forms regarding something along the lines of my righs, health insurance information, my medical history, contact information, and who knows what else. After that I waited about about 20 minutes in the pleasantly empty waiting area before seeing the doc. Our visit lasted about 5 minutes. I gave him a two sentence description of how I became injured and then he did a physical exam of my injury (the calf-squeeze test). It was definitely a partial tear, he said it moved-but a lot less than the intact achilles so I needed to get an MRI. Other than knowing that if my tear was more that 50% I should have surgery, I learned very little and left somewhat disappointed.

		<h3><span class="entry-day">4-5 Months</span>: Normalcy<span class="entry-date"> July 2017</span></h3>
<!-- 		<h6>What Is Normal? (thoughts from May)</h6>
		<p>
			Afer a few of my various doctor appointments I quickly understood that my definitily of normal is not entirely conventional. I would have to redefine normal in order to set realistic expectations for myself. For me, normal has always been playing soccer 3-5 days a week. Going hiking two or three days a month. Biking to the pool once a week for a swim. Attempting to build an igloo, even when the calliber blizzard is grossly overestimated by the weather people and there is not nearly enough snow. Trying to convince everyone I know to go camping all the time. Having two beers without my ankle swelling even more than its already puffed up today. But apparently not all of these things are entirely normal...
			</p>
			<p>They (one of the many doctorish people I've seen over the last few months) said I will be back to normal/everyday activities 4-5 months post-op. That is thrilling to hear at first, until you reailze that normal and everyday activities do not include hiking or camping, starting kickboxing classes or awkward dancing. They definitely do not include soccer of any kind, though I will at least be juggleing by then to keep myself from going crazy. At least there's PT to look forward to...</p>
