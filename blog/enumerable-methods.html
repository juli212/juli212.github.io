		<h2>Enumerables#Map</h2>
		<h6>February 20, 2016</h6>
		<p>
			In Ruby, classes such as Arrays and Hashes are objects. Each individual Array and Hash is conveniently also an object. Strings, integers, etc., are also objects. Ruby is basically tons of objects inside of objects inside of objects...Just like Inception! Anyway, the importance of classes is that they help define behaviors and specify atrributes for specific groups of objects (in this case, each group of objects would be a class). Certain classes of objects will respond to a specific method one way while other classes of objects will respond to that same method differently, or not at all.
		</p>
		<h3>What Is An Enumerable?</h3>
    
		<p>
			Enumerables are a package of methods that can be given to classes but rather than having to assign each enumerable method to a class individually, they are all grouped together so all you have to do is tell a Ruby class to include the enumerables for a specific class. Then all of the enumerable methods are available to be used for that class! Many enumerables are used to iterate through a block of code similar to the way the .each method functions but they will have different results, depending on the specific function. 
		</p>
		<h3>What is #map ???</h3>
		<p>
			The #map method is an enumerable method that iterates through a code block and modifies each element and returns the modified objects as a new collection of objects. Ever heard of the #collect method? Then #map may sound familiar since the two methods basically do the same thing...
		</p>
        <p>
        	An example of the #map enumerable method:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        	<pre>
        		<code>
        		> num_array = (1..15).to_a
        		=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
        		> num_array.map {|number| number % 3 == 0 }
        		=> [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
        		</code>
        	</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        	Here we have an Array of integers and the enumerable #map method will iterate through each object of the array and divide by 3. It will then return a new array including only integers which are divisible by 3 with no remainder. In this situation, the returned array contains the integers who return a value of true when passed through the block of code. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	Similarly, the #collect method will return the same results for the given Array num_array:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        	<pre>
        		<code>
        		> num_array = (1..15).to_a
        		=>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
        		> num_array.collect {|number| number % 3 == 0 }
        		=> [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
        		</code>
        	</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        	In both cases, each integer from 1-15 is being divided by 3 and if the remainder is 0, the result is considered true. Then that integer is added to the new array that is being returned as a result. The integers which have a non-zero remainder are excluded from the returned array because the statement inside the code block returns false for them. In essence, the #map method is asking which of these integers are divisible by 3 with no remainder? If they are divisble, they are included in the returned array.
        </p>
