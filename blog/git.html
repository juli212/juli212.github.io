    <h2>Benefits of version control</h2>
    
    <section>
      <p>
          Using version control allows developers to make changes to their code with a low risk of completely ruining their previous work. Saving or committing code frequently is a great safety net that maps out all of the changes a developer has made. He or she can easily revert to an older version of their code in order to restore something that may have been messed up in a newer version of the code. Without version control, there would be a lot more risk and disorganization when updating files since there would be no previous versions to fall back on.
      </p>
      <h2>Git Tracking Changes</h2>
      <p>
          Every time you commit a file on Git, you have a snapshot of your code that can be pushed to your remote repositories on GitHub. The changes you make through Git are easy to track and to revert to. Git also allows multiple developers to work on the same code files simultaneously without disrupting each other or the live code. Once everyone has completed their code and given pull requests, developers will look over other team members' code and merge everything down into the master/live repository. If there are mistakes, developers have a chance to catch them before they are merged into the master code.
      </p>
      <h2>Storing code with GitHub</h2>
      <p>
          Storing code remotely on GitHub makes the files easily accessible for you and for your collaborators while. GitHub also provides built in documentation tools and saves a history of all changes committed to the master repository. In addition to this, GitHub is a great way to build a portfolio that allows users to easily share projects they have completed which can be very helpful for gaining employment (or just showing off...).
