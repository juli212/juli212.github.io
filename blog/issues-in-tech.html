		<h2>Diversity In Tech</h2>

		<h3>Women and the Workplace</h3>
    
		<p>
			As a girl, and a soon-to-be-programmer, the existance and acceptance of females in tech fields is interesting and relevant to me. When I tell people I am participating in a programming bootcamp, I have heard a number of responses. From within the industry (the words of a guy who  actually went through DBC about a year ago): "Well, at least you're a girl, so you won't have a problem getting a job..." Which is almost a comforting thing to hear, though it seems to already downplaying my talent and skills and knowledge by implying I would get hired for being a female, rather than for any other abilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, I have heard from men that this is completely untrue! In fact, they say it is the opposite and will be more difficult for me to get a job as a female because there are fewer of us currently in the industry. Obviously, all of my advice seems to be coming from men, not women. Maybe us ladies are quieter about it? Through playing soccer, I do know two people who have been through DBC, one is a guy and the other is a girl. Both loved the experience and are now living in NYC while holding down programming jobs. Beyond that? I'm sure there are a few differences...
		</p>
		<p>
			My question is, depending on whether or not the dirth of females in tech companies is what Bonnie Marcus referrs to as a 'pipeline issue' or if it goes beyond the lack of qualified female candidates, should I be playing up the fact that I am a female coder just to get in someplace? Or is it better if I make my gender less apparent, hoping a hiring company will overlook my femininity and hire me anyway?
		</p>
		<p>
			The pipeline theory claims that our culture is to blame on a pretty basic level since our little girls are subtly steered away from tech-heavy fields at a very young age. Bonnie disagrees however, claiming that gender itself (as well as race) is keeping women out. She sites sexual, age, and race discrimination women deal with in these male-dominant fields, along with general discomfort, that eventually leads women to exit the field in order to find more supportive work environments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interestingly, Catalyst (a non-profet research institution that focuses on the advancement of women) found that women have not just been kept out of tech-specific roles. On the financial side of things, women seem to stay away from tech-related businesses where they also feel like outsiders since the industry itself is controlled and mostly populated by men. Catalyst claims that while education plays a part in keeping women out, it is the male-dominated industry and corporate world that repels many women attempting to enter the field, as well as pushing away a majority of females who have already been allowed entry.

			Not even going to touch the leadership side of things...
