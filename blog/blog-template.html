How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	I enjoy working with other people but since we were designing different wireframes, we ended up doing most of the work individually while discussing what problems we were having with the design. For instance, I am unclear about whether our blog is going to be a completely separate website from our [username].github.io site or if it will be a sectioon of that site. We discussed that for a while even though it was not completely relevant to the task. In the case of the HTML, it was so simple that I think I could have finished the task more quickly on my own but working with a pair is definitely more fun and we did bounce a couple of ideas for formatting off each other, mostly about whethr we should add things to the template or wait until we are supposed to add CSS and more styling.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
	It makes the process more mindless which can be a good thing if your wireframe is well thought out. Since my wireframe is relatively simple, I could just follow it and write the appropriate HTML withoout having to imagine how it might look since I had already done that when creating my wireframe. It is like a roadmap for writing HTML. The thought that I may have to change my wireframe in the future did cross my mind a number of times but I woud not change it yet, I want to wait for more content.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
	We talked about simplicity both of wireframes and of the actual website. In my experience, the more complicated a website is, the more difficult it is to use. Sometimes they look amazing but it can take ages to find a very simple thing on them that should be very obvious and easy to use/find.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
	I remembered the tag for a horizontal line <hr>.
