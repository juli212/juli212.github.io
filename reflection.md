# 3.5 Reflection



## What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?


Borders are very helpful for me when I am unsure of an element's position. I will add a border just to see where exactly it is and change distances to move it around until I like where it is relative to the other elements on the page and also how it looks visually once I remove the border. I know that padding is the space between the content of an element and the inside of the border while the margin is outside the border and is the distance between the outside of an element and whatever element is containing it.


## What did you learn about CSS positioning?


I learned more about the relationship between an element that has absolute positioning and is inside an element with relative positioning. I also tried to use fixed positioning because I wanted something to stay on the page as I scrolled but if the browser window becomes too small, that element just does not show up at all and that was very frustrating. I removed the fixed positioning and decided this would be something to work on another time.



## What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?


I spent the most time working on my navigation bar at the top of my window. I did not finish it but figured it was good enough for now. At the moment it is a single layer horizontal nav bar but I would like to add a dropdown portion to it but could not figure out the proper css so I left that for another time. I also left out an inner side navigation bar because it will not be necessary once I get the dropdown portion of my top navigation bar working! Generally, changing the sizes of text and photos seemed like the simplest things for me. I ended up also spending a lot of time deciding on which images I wanted to use and then formatting them before I even added them to the html.



## What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?


Positioning is the most difficult aspect for me at the moment but earlier ths week, I found a number of good resources that I want to review about it. I also definitely prefer to add horizontal and vertical (and diagonal) lines using css, rather than html. I really enjoy the formatting process, it is very interesting to see how different css tags work with each other. I also learned how easy it is to add two separate stylesheets and have one follow the other. It is nice that anything further down on the page will overwrite any previous css so if you need to change one small part of a specific page, you can simply write a small css and add it to that one html page.
